  "content": "Oleksandr Yefremov, the former head of Party of Regions faction in parliament, was slapped with a new charge after being released on bail in the evening of Feb. 17, Ukraine's prosecutor's office said. He is now accused of inciting ethnic hatred, on top of earlier charges of abuse of office and forgery. Moreover, State Security Service chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko told Hromadske TV that Yefremov is also investigated for financing separatism. “Within the investigations of criminal cases he was served notices for, there are materials that concern his financing of separatism in Luhansk Oblast,” Nalyvaichenko said. Yefremov's arrest on Valentine's Day was one of the first moves by Viktor Shokin, the new general prosecutor who was appointed last week. He was released on bail of Hr 3.7 million, paid for him by his fellow party member Borys Kolesnikov, a business tycoon who owns a confectionery empire. On Wednesday morning, Yefremov showed up for a new round of questioning at the prosecutor's office. He was also expected at the Pechersk court in Kyiv later in the day, where the judge was to decide on his potential new detention. “I’m so grateful to Boris Kolesnikov, because otherwise it won’t be possible for me to speak here,” Yefremov told journalists and his supporters outside the prosecutor's office in Podil. Kolesnikov himself had been in a similar position before. He was arrested soon after the Orange Revolution in 2005 and accused of abuse of office, extortion and making a death threat. The charges were later dropped.",
