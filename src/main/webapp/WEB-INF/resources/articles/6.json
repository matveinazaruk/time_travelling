  "content": "Russian Internet giant Yandex has requested that Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service investigate Google for violating Russian legislation, news agency RIA Novosti reported on Wednesday. The regulator now has one month to consider the request from Yandex, Russia's top search engine and provider of a range of digital services, such as Yandex.Maps and Yandex.Music, a music streaming service. Yandex claims that its mobile applications are being shut out of Google Play, the application store for Google's Android mobile operating software. A recent report by U.S. investment firm Morgan Stanley found that 70 percent of smartphones in Russia run on Android software. Yandex's head of product distribution, Yury Vecher, wrote on news website Slon.ru that the company lodged the complaint after finding it impossible to have its services — which mirror those of Google's, but are often better tailored for the Russian market — installed on Android devices sold in Russia.",
