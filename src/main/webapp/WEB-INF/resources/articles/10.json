  "content": "One in every three Russians (35 percent) expects their family's income to fall within the next three months due to anticipated wage cuts as the country struggles with a crippling economic decline, according to a recent survey. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said that either their salary payments or those of their family members would likely experience delays, the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM) said on its website. Thirty percent of respondents anticipated reduced hours at work, or compulsory unpaid leave, either on behalf of themselves or their family members, according to the poll. A quarter of respondents (26 percent) voiced the expectation that either they or their family members would be fired, and 38 percent anticipated firings at work in general, according to the survey, conducted on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. Thirty-nine percent said that finding a similar job to the one they currently hold would be difficult or impossible. Twenty-four percent of respondents said they had friends or family members who had lost their jobs in the past three months. Of those respondents, the average said that they knew of three people who lost their jobs. The survey was conducted among 1,600 people across 46 regions of Russia. The statistical margin of error did not exceed 3.5 percent, the pollster said.",
